# westover.lol

Experimental playground for noodling projects and silly ideas.

## What is this?

This domain serves as a public hosting space for experimental projects, prototypes, and ideas that don't fit anywhere else. Most content will be behind Cloudflare Access control, but occasionally something fun might be publicly accessible.

## Philosophy

- **Experimental**: Nothing here is production-ready
- **Ephemeral**: Projects may come and go without notice
- **Fun**: This is where the silly ideas live
- **No Promises**: Don't depend on anything staying around

## Setup

This is a GitHub Pages site with a custom domain:
- Domain: westover.lol
- DNS: Cloudflare
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Repository: https://github.com/westover/westover.lol

## Projects

Projects will be added as subdirectories or subdomains as needed. Check the commit history to see what's been deployed.
